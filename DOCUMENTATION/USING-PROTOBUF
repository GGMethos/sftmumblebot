[ Protobuff and how we use it ]

Google Protobuff is a framework for generating valid packets corresponding to a protocol.
Using it you can avoid implementing the Protocol yourself but use the Protobuff api functions.
For example we use this call in the file MumbleConnection.py:
        pbMess = Mumble_pb2.TextMessage()
to generate valid text message Packets.

For using this service you need a generated pb_file containing the protocol specific data.
In thes Projekt it's the file "Mumble_pb2.py" 
It is generated from the abstract definition of the protocol written down in the file
"Mumble.proto" which is located in this doc folder. 
You can generate it using
    $>protoc --python_out=DST_DIR Mumble.proto

We deliver a pre generated Mumble_pb2.py file within this git repo.
These instructions are just relevant for understanding protobuf or if you 
want to generate the file for yourself for any reason.

You find a human-readable description of the Mumble Protocol(v 1.2.3) in the pdf
  "doc_mumble-protocol.pdf" 

That's all.
